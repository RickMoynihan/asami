# asami [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/threatgrid/asami.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/threatgrid/asami)

An in-memory graph database, for Clojure and ClojureScript.

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/org.clojars.quoll/asami/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/org.clojars.quoll/asami)

Asami is a _schemaless_ database, meaning that data may be inserted with no predefined schema. This flexibility has advantages and disadvantages. It is easier to load and evolve data over time without a schema. However, functionality like upsert and basic integrity checking is not available in the same way as with a graph with a predefined schema.

Asami also follows an _Open World Assumption_ model, in the same way that [RDF](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer) does. In practice, this has very little effect on the database, beyond what being schemaless provides.

Asami has a query API that looks very similar to a simplified Datomic. More details are available in the [Query documentation](https://github.com/threatgrid/asami/wiki/Querying).

## Usage

The [Asami API](https://github.com/threatgrid/asami/wiki/Asami-API) tries to look a little like Datomic.

The following can be copy/pasted into a repl.:

```clojure
(require '[asami.core :as d])

;; Create an in-memory database, named dbname
(def db-uri "asami:mem://dbname")
(d/create-database db-uri)

;; Create a connection to the database
(def conn (d/connect db-uri))

;; Data can be loaded into a database either as objects, or "add" statements:
(def first-movies [{:movie/title "Explorers"
                    :movie/genre "adventure/comedy/family"
                    :movie/release-year 1985}
                   {:movie/title "Demolition Man"
                    :movie/genre "action/sci-fi/thriller"
                    :movie/release-year 1993}
                   {:movie/title "Johnny Mnemonic"
                    :movie/genre "cyber-punk/action"
                    :movie/release-year 1995}
                   {:movie/title "Toy Story"
                    :movie/genre "animation/adventure"
                    :movie/release-year 1995}])

(d/transact conn {:tx-data first-movies})
```
The [`transact`](https://github.com/threatgrid/asami/wiki/Asami-API#transact) operation returns an object that can be _dereferenced_ (via `clojure.core/deref` or the `@` macro) to provide information about the state of the database before and after the transaction. (A _future_ in Clojure, or a _delay_ in ClojureScript). Note that the transaction data can be provided as the `:tx-data` in a map object if other paramters are to be provided, or just as a raw sequence without the wrapping map.

With the data loaded, a database value can be retrieved from the database and then queried:

```clojure
(def db (d/db conn))

(d/q '[:find ?movie-title
       :where [?m :movie/title ?movie-title]] db)
```
This returns the a sequence of results, with each result being a sequence of the selected vars in the `:find` clause (just `?movie-title` in this case):
```
(["Explorers"]
 ["Demolition Man"]
 ["Johnny Mnemonic"]
 ["Toy Story"])
```
A more complex query could be to get the title, year and genre for all movies after 1990:
```clojure
(d/q '[:find ?title ?year ?genre
       :where [?m :movie/title ?title]
              [?m :movie/release-year ?year]
              [?m :movie/genre ?genre]
              [(> ?year 1990)]] db)
```
Entities found in a query can be extracted back out as objects using the [`entity`](https://github.com/threatgrid/asami/wiki/Asami-API#entity) function. For instance, the following is a repl session that looks up the movies released in 1995, and then gets the associated entities:
```clojure
;; find the entity IDs. The :find clause asks for a list of just the ?m variable
=> (d/q '[:find [?m ...] :where [?m :movie/release-year 1995]] db)
(:tg/node-10327 :tg/node-10326)

;; get a single entity
=> (d/entity db :tg/node-10327)
#:movie{:title "Toy Story",
        :genre "animation/adventure",
        :release-year 1995}

;; get all the entities from the query
=> (map #(d/entity db %)
        (d/q '[:find [?m ...] :where [?m :movie/release-year 1995]] db))
(#:movie{:title "Toy Story",
         :genre "animation/adventure",
         :release-year 1995}
 #:movie{:title "Johnny Mnemonic",
         :genre "cyber-punk/action",
         :release-year 1995})
```
See the [Query Documentation](https://github.com/threatgrid/asami/wiki/Querying) for more information on querying.

### Updates
The _Open World Assumption_ allows each attribute to be multi-arity. In a _Closed World_ database an object may be loaded to replace those attributes that can only appear once. To do the same thing with Asami, annotate the attributes to be replaced with a quote character at the end of the attribute name. 
```clojure
=> (def toy-story (d/q '[:find ?ts . :where [?ts :movie/title "Toy Story"]] db))
=> (d/transact conn [{:db/id toy-story :movie/genre' "animation/adventure/comedy"}])
=> (d/entity (d/db conn) toy-story)
#:movie{:title "Toy Story",
        :genre "animation/adventure/comedy",
        :release-year 1995}
```
Addressing nodes by their internal ID can be cumbersome. They can also be addressed by a `:db/ident` field if one is provided.
```clojure
(def tx (d/transact conn [{:db/ident "sense"
                           :movie/title "Sense and Sensibility"
                           :movie/genre "drama/romance"
                           :movie/release-year 1996}]))

;; ask the transaction for the node ID, instead of querying
(def sense (get (:tempids @tx) "sense"))
(d/entity (d/db conn) sense)
```
This returns the new movie. However, the `:db/ident` attribute is hidden in the entity:
```clojure
#:movie{:title "Sense and Sensibility", :genre "drama/romance", :release-year 1996}
```
However, all of the attributes are still present in the graph:
```clojure
=> (d/q '[:find ?a ?v :in $ ?s :where [?s ?a ?v]] (d/db conn) sense)
([:db/ident "sense"] [:movie/title "Sense and Sensibility"] [:movie/genre "drama/romance"] [:movie/release-year 1996])
```
The release year of this movie is incorrectly set to the release in the USA, and not the initial release. That can be updated using the `:db/ident` field:
```clojure
=> (d/transact conn [{:db/ident "sense" :movie/release-year' 1995}])
=> (d/entity (d/db conn) sense)
#:movie{:title "Sense and Sensibility", :genre "drama/romance", :release-year 1995}
```

## Analytics
Asami also has some support for graph analytics. These all operate on the _graph_ part of a database value, which can be retrieved with the `asami.core/graph` function.

Start by populating a graph with the cast of ["The Flintstones"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053502/). So that we can refer to entities after they have been created, we can provide them with temporary ID values. These are just negative numbers, and can be used elsewhere in the transaction to refer to the same entity. We will also avoid the `:tx-data` wrapper in the transaction:
```clojure
(require '[asami.core :as d])
(require '[asami.analytics :as aa])

(def db-uri "asami:mem://data")
(d/create-database db-uri)
(def conn (d/connect db-uri))

(def data [{:db/id -1 :name "Fred"}
           {:db/id -2 :name "Wilma"}
           {:db/id -3 :name "Pebbles"}
           {:db/id -4 :name "Dino" :species "Dinosaur"}
           {:db/id -5 :name "Barney"}
           {:db/id -6 :name "Betty"}
           {:db/id -7 :name "Bamm-Bamm"}
           [:db/add -1 :spouse -2]
           [:db/add -2 :spouse -1]
           [:db/add -1 :child -3]
           [:db/add -2 :child -3]
           [:db/add -1 :pet -4]
           [:db/add -5 :spouse -6]
           [:db/add -6 :spouse -5]
           [:db/add -5 :child -7]
           [:db/add -6 :child -7]])

(d/transact conn data)
```
Fred, Wilma, Pebbles, and Dino are all connected in a subgraph. Barney, Betty and Bamm-Bamm are connected in a separate subgraph.

Let's find the subgraph from Fred:
```clojure
(def db (d/db conn))
(def graph (d/graph db))
(def fred (d/q '[:find ?e . :where [?e :name "Fred"]] db))

(aa/subgraph-from-node graph fred)
```
This returns the _nodes_ in the graph, but not the scalar values. For instance:
```clojure
#{:tg/node-10330 :tg/node-10329 :tg/node-10331 :tg/node-10332}
```
These nodes can be used as the input to a query to get their names:
```clojure
=> (d/q '[:find [?name ...] :in $ [?n ...] :where [?n :name ?name]]
        db
        (aa/subgraph-from-node graph fred))
("Fred" "Pebbles" "Dino" "Wilma")
```

We can also get all the subgraphs:
```clojure
=> (count (aa/subgraphs graph))
2

;; execute the same query for each subgraph
=> (map (partial d/q '[:find [?name ...] :where [?e :name ?name]])
        (aa/subgraphs graph))
(("Fred" "Wilma" "Pebbles" "Dino") ("Barney" "Betty" "Bamm-Bamm"))
```

### Loom
Asami also implements [Loom](https://github.com/aysylu/loom) via the [Asami-Loom](https://github.com/threatgrid/asami-loom) package.
Include the following dependency for your project:
```
[org.clojars.quoll/asami-loom "0.2.0"]
```

Graphs can now be analyzed with Loom functions.

If functions are provided to Loom, then they can be used to provide labels for creating a visual graph. The following creates some simple queries to get the labels for edges and nodes:
```clojure
(require '[asami-loom.index])
(require '[asami-loom.label])
(require '[loom.io])

(defn edge-label [g s d]
  (str (d/q '[:find ?e . :in $ ?a ?b :where (or [?a ?e ?b] [?b ?e ?a])] g s d)))
  
(defn node-label [g n]
  (or (d/q '[:find ?name . :where [?n :name ?name]] g n) "-"))

;; create a PDF of the graph
(loom-io/view (graph db) :fmt :pdg :alg :sfpd :edge-label edge-label :node-label node-label)
```
